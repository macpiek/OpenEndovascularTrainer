# Open Endovascular Trainer

This prototype demonstrates a basic browser-based simulator for guiding a flexible wire through a branched vessel. The physics uses a simple Verlet rope model with collisions against vessel walls. The visual style mimics fluoroscopy by using a monochrome palette and persistent trail.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Use the arrow keys to advance the guidewire and navigate through the branching vessel.
